    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>6 chicken thighs, bone in or out, with or without skin*</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper, to season</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder, to season</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>1/3 cup honey</li>
      <li>1/4 cup water (or chicken broth)</li>
      <li>
        2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar (or apple cider vinegar, or any white
        vinegar)
      </li>
      <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Season chicken with salt, pepper and garlic powder; set aside.</li>
      <li>
        Heat a pan or skillet over medium high heat; sear chicken thigh fillets
        or breast fillets on both sides until golden and cooked through.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>FOR BONE IN THIGHS:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Reduce heat after searing on both sides, cover skillet with a lid and
        continue cooking until the chicken is cooked through, while turning
        every 5 minutes until done. Alternatively, see notes for oven method.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain most of the excess oil from the pan, leaving about 2 tablespoons
        of pan juiced for added flavour.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>FOR SAUCE</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        When chicken is done and cooked through, arrange chicken skin-side up in
        the pan (if cooking with skin); add the garlic between the chicken and
        fry until fragrant (about 30 seconds). Add the honey, water, vinegar and
        soy sauce. Increase heat to medium-high and continue to cook until the
        sauce reduces down and thicken slightly (about 3-4 minutes).
      </li>
      <li>
        Garnish with parsley and serve over vegetables, rice, pasta or with a
        salad.
      </li>
    </ol>
