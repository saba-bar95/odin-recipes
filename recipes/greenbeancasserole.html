    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
      <li>
        Bring 2 quarts (litres) of salted water to the boil in a large pot over
        medium-high heat. Add beans and boil for about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain in a colander and quickly immerse beans in a large bowl of ice
        water to stop the cooking process. Drain and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt the butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté onion for 2 to
        3 minutes until softened. Cook garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add mushrooms and cook for 5 minutes. Pour in wine (if using) and allow
        to cook for 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle mushrooms with flour, mix well and cook for 2 minutes. Add the
        broth and simmer for 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to medium-low, season with salt, pepper and crumbled
        bouillon. Stir in the cream or half and half. Cook until the soup
        thickens (about 4-5 minutes).
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the heat and stir in the cooked green beans with half of the
        onions. Top with the remaining onions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake until bubbling, about 15 minutes. Remove and serve immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
